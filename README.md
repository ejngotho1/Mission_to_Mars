# Mission to Mars

## Overview of Project
Robin's web app is looking good and functioning well, but she wants to add more polish to it. She has realized that the site is scraping-friendly. Now she would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. We will use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images. 

1. ***Deliverable 1***: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
2. ***Deliverable 2***: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
3. ***Deliverable 3***: Add Bootstrap 3 Components
4. ***Extra***: A written report on the employee database analysis [`README.md`](https://github.com/emmanuelmartinezs/Mission-to-Mars). 

## Resources 

* Data Source: `Mission_to_Mars.ipynb`, `app.py`, `scraping.py` and `index.html`
* Data Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Python and MongoDB
* Software: MongoDB, Python 3.8.3, Visual Studio Code 1.50.0, Flask Version 1.0.2

## Deliverable 1:  Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
### Deliverable Requirements:
Using BeautifulSoup and Splinter, you’ll scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images.

1. Make a copy of your `Mission_to_Mars.ipynb` file, and rename it `Mission_to_Mars_Challenge.ipynb`. 
2. Download the `Mission_to_Mars_Challenge_starter_code.ipynb`, copy the starter code, and paste at the end of your `Mission_to_Mars_Challenge.ipynb` file.
3. ​In Step 1, use your browser to visit the [`Mars Hemispheres`](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars) website to view the hemisphere images.
4. Use the DevTools to inspect the page for the proper elements to scrape. You will need to retrieve the full-resolution image for each of Mars's hemispheres.

 ##### use your browser to visit the [`Mars Hemispheres`](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars) website to view the hemisphere images.**

````python
# 1. Use browser to visit the URL 
url = 'https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars'
browser.visit(url)

# 2. Create a list to hold the images and titles.
hemisphere_image_urls = []
````

## Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars’s Hemisphere Images and Titles
### Deliverable Requirements:
Using your Python and HTML skills, you’ll add the code you created in Deliverable 1 to your `scraping.py` file, update your Mongo database, and modify your `index.html` file so the webpage contains all the information you collected in this module as well as the full-resolution image and title for each hemisphere image

1. The `scraping.py` file contains code that retrieves the full-resolution image URL and title for each hemisphere image. 
2. The Mongo database is updated to contain the full-resolution image URL and title for each hemisphere image.
3. The index.html file contains code that will display the full-resolution image URL and title for each hemisphere image.
4. After the scraping has been completed, the web app contains all the information from this module and the full-resolution images and titles for the four hemisphere images.

### Results and Analysis
### Code

from splinter import Browser
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as soup
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager
import pandas as pd
import datetime as dt

#### define function to initialize browser, create dictionary and exit the browser

#### MISSION TO MARS CHALLENGE

##### Exported and Cleaned Mission_to_Mars_Challenge.ipynb code to scraping.py 

##### Import Splinter, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas
